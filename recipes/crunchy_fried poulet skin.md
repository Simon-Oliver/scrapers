    # Crunchy Fried Poulet Skin

    What is the best part of a rotisserie poulet? Of course the crunchy skin! So why not put a focus on this delicatesse.

Here's my intepretation of crunchy poulet skin:
First free the chicken skin from most of the fat. Next place it on baking paper and wrap in cling film. Then stew in the oven for 3-5 minutes. Next dry at 90°C  for 1½ hours.
Final step deep-fry until crunchy and golden brown.
