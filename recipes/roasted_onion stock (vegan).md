    Vegan dishes are increasingly demanded. Here my recipe for a  vegan stock. Great to pour on risotto or for vegetable soups.  

Ingredients
- 700g water
- 2 pcs. celeriac
- 4pcs carrots
- 5pcs Champgnion
- 3pcs Onions
- 15pcs White Onions in Julienne cut (Gold Brown)

Preparation
Cut celery, carrots, onions and mushrooms into cubes. Then add salt and season with pepper, marinate well with rapeseed oil and place on a baking tray in a combi-steamer at 205 degree Celcius. Fry for approx. 30 minutes until dark brown, mixing the cubes in between (or roast them in a pan like in the video).
Bring the roasted cubes to the boil with 0.7l of water and let them stand for 45 minutes.

Peel white onions, cut them into rings and fry them in a little oil with color, then reduce the heat so that the juice can escape, then reduce and again fry.
Repeat this process 3 times until the onions are completely soft and the mixture has a golden yellow color.

Add roasted vegetable stock, bring to the boil once and reduce for 10 minutes. Afterwards let it covered draw for 45 minutes.
