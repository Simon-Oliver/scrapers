    # Kristal Caviar Veloute

    Veloute or Velvet sauce is a basic white sauce in classic French cuisine. This is my interpretation of it ðŸ˜ƒ

Glaze 200 shalots, 100 g leek (only the white bit), 50 g garlic and 2 laurel leaves in butter for 10 -15 min. Deglaze with 200 ml white wine and add 500 ml chicken fond. Next add 100 g white champignons and 100 ml cream. Sieve the mass and add 200 g butter.

For another another layer of flavour add lemon zest and juice. Right before your serve it mix 60 g caviar into the veloute.
