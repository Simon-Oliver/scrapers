    Cucumber Ash is part of my signature dish: Kohlrabi Ravioli | Burnt Cucumber Creme | Caviar Kristal

It might seem a bit unconventional, but this flavour is very aromatic and nothing like you've ever tasted before.

This is how you create this unique flavour:
- Quater a cucumber.
- Put the cucumber in a preheated oven (220Â°) until it's gone completely black. There should be no liquid left in the cucumber.
- Put the burnt cucumber in a mixer.
- Use the cucumber ash to season dishes and add some colour to them.
