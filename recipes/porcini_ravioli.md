    Porchino mushrooms are a great side dish, but also work perfectly as a main course. You cannot get enough of that fresh and earthy taste. I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I do ðŸ˜€

For the filling:
Finely chop up shallots and porchino mushrooms.
Roast gently in pan with butter. When browned, add white wine and cream. Next add a pinch of nutmeg. Final step for the filling: add parmesan until it thickens. Put the mass in a frosting bag.

For the ravioli:
Roll the pasta dough flat and put it on a flour covered surface. Then put the filling on the dough, Â about 5 cm apart. Put egg white on the sides of the ravioli and cover them with the remaining dough. Cut the ravioli out and make sure they are closed tightly.
Cook them in salted water for 4-5 minutes. Â
