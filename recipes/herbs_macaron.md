    Macarons don't have to be a dessert - here's my savoury take on the french cookie:

Ingredients:
235g egg white
298g sugar
270g ground almonds
290g powdered sugar 
2g salt
1g white pepper
3g dried herbs
5g egg white poweder
3g herb oil

First mix the herbs, powdered sugar and white pepper.
Add the almonds and mix well.
Next add the egg white and the sugar.
Put in a Macaron mould and bake at 140° for 18 minutes.

I served my macarons with chervil mayonnaise, salmon trout tartare and chervil. What would you serve it with? Leave me a comment
